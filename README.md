🏀 Predict Basketball Player Efficiency Ratings
Welcome to the Predict Basketball Player Efficiency Ratings project repository! This project is part of the Microsoft Learn course, which uses data science and machine learning techniques to analyze basketball player efficiency ratings, inspired by the movie Space Jam: A New Legacy.

📚 Introduction
This project uses anonymized data from real and animated basketball players to create a machine learning model for cleansing and analyzing data to be used during games. The course leverages Python and Visual Studio Code to explore bimodal data distributions and apply various data science techniques.

🎯 Course Objectives

-Utilize Python, pandas, and Visual Studio Code for data analysis.

-Cleanse and manipulate data that requires critical analysis.

-Apply machine learning techniques to cleanse and complete data.

-Prepare data for multiple customer-facing purposes.
