# üèÄ Optimize Basketball Game Play with Visual Studio Code

Welcome to the **Optimize Basketball Game Play with Visual Studio Code** project repository! This project is part of the Microsoft Learn course, which uses data science and machine learning techniques to analyze basketball player efficiency ratings, inspired by the movie *Space Jam: A New Legacy*.

## üìö Introduction

Inspired by the new movie *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, this learning path shows basketball fans how understanding data science and coding can support their passions, create opportunities, and even open doors to potential careers. Develop skills using Visual Studio Code, Azure, GitHub, and languages like JavaScript and Python to see how single moments in a player‚Äôs history can lead to critical decisions during game finals.

## üéØ Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:

        - üêç Utilize Python, pandas, and Visual Studio Code for data analysis.
        - üßπ Cleanse and manipulate data that requires critical analysis.
        - ü§ñ Apply machine learning techniques to cleanse and complete data.
        - üèóÔ∏è Prepare data for multiple customer-facing purposes.
        - üèÄ Use JavaScript, Azure, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code to create a web app that helps the Tune Squad coach make data-driven decisions on the basketball court.
        - üíª Deploy applications in the cloud using GitHub Actions.
        - üåê Explore the CodeTour extension in Visual Studio Code for coding guidance.
        - üìä Create and deploy a Water Break app using JavaScript and Azure Static Web Apps.
        - üöÄ Understand the basics of mixed reality and prepare resources for creating interactive environments.
